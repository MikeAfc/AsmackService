= Accounts =

Accounts keep the basic user information:
- JID
- Password
- connection string

= Connection Strings =

AsmackService uses connection strings that borrow ideas from database
connection strings.

Currently supported schemas:
- tcp:ipv4
- tcp:ipv4:port
- tcp:[ipv6]
- tcp:[ipv6]:port
- tcp:domain
- tcp:domain:port
- xmpp:domain
where xmpp performs a DNS/SRV lookup.

= Core stanza receiving =

All connections are currently ending with a XmppInputStream.
A PullToPush thread calls nextStanza (which is delegated to XMLUtils) to get a
single XML fragment.

This fragment is then broadcasted by the XMPP transport service.

= Core stanza sending =

XMPPTransportService looks for the correct connection and calls send on the
connection instance. The connection instance checks the xml structure and sends
a raw text block after verification.
